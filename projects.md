# Projects

## Applied projects

- **Graph-based time-series forecasting**  
  I am working on extending the current use of Generalised Network Autorregresive (GNAR) models to macroeconomic forecasting.

## Theoretical projects

- **Singular Learning Theory**  
  I am working on a paper which used Singular Learning Theory to better understand the grokking phenomena through SLT's Bayesian lens.
