# Hi, I'm Sergio Estan Ruiz

I am a PhD student in Statistics at Imperial College London. I work on time series modelling and machine learning for public policy, with a focus on multivariate/network time series and macroeconomic applications. 

I am also interested in singular learning theory as a tool to understanding model training through a Bayesian framework. On top of this, I have played around with topological data analysis in the past and have an interest in geometric/topological tools in machine learning. 

As a whole, I am pretty much interested in learning anything! I'm always happy to talk about maths, machine learning, economics and more!
